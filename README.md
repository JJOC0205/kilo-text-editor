# Kilo Terminal Text Editor

A version of ***Kilo***, a text editor for your terminal

I followed the guide 
[*Build Your Own Text Editor*](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html). 
This book was written by Snaptoken, however Kilo was originally designed by Salvatore Sanfilippo, aka antirez.

## Overview

This was designed using primarily standard C libraries.

## How to Use

To use Kilo, clone the repo, and navigate to the repo on your machine.
Then, compile the project using `make kilo`.
Run with `./kilo`
